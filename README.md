# Building App

First we will create a basic react application, and then we will add a connect to metamask button. The application will also check if MetaMask extension is installed or not. If it is not installed, the application will display a message to download the extension.

Once the account is connected, we will display the connected account address.

Letâ€™s get to coding first. Fire your terminal and add the following instructions:

    mkdir helloreact
    cd helloreact
    npx create-react-app my-app

This will first create a helloreact folder and then my-app, a basic react application for you. Go ahead and write the following command.

    cd my-app
    npm start

This will start your server and automatically open a window for you, where you can see the default react app.
